Hi! My name is Gabe.
======

Over the past four years, I’ve led data science efforts at Deloitte, where I help design and deploy a fraud detection engine used by state SNAP and Medicaid agencies nationwide. My work spans end-to-end model development, cloud infrastructure design, scalable deployment, client engagement, and team mentorship.

I’m especially driven by the opportunity to apply AI responsibly to improve government services and advance equity. I love mentoring, collaborating, and learning from others — and moving forward, I’m committed to sharing more of what I’ve learned through writing and community engagement.
