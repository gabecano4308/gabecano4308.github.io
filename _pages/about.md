Hi! I'm Gabe, a Data Scientist with six years of experience working in the government and healthcare sectors.

About Me
======

My professional career began as a Project Manager for Epic Systems, where I helped hospitals set up the software that their staff use to manage patient information. At the time, my work was technical-adjacent -- I configured the software on the front-end, but wasn't "coding" like my developer teammates. Their work piqued my interest and I craved a new challenge. So, I quit my job, spent a month hiking from Duluth to Canada, and started an immersive Data Science bootcamp!

Fast-forward to today, I've spent the last four years at Deloitte, working on a Fraud Detection engine used by state government agencies across the U.S.

Making the switch to Data Science was one of the best decisions of my life. Each day, I get to tackle complex challenges that blend creativity with analytical thinking, and I am constantly finding opportunities to learn something new.
